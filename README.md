### Features

* Modeled and visualized planetary trajectory with Newton's law of gravitation in Java and StdDraw.
* Read in data and implement variable declaration, constructor, functional calling, loops, order of operations to calculate force among planets and simulate their interaction.

### Requirements

* First, compile NBody.java by enter "javac NBody.java" in command line
* Second, call NBody.java with arguments by enter "java NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 planets.txt" in command line
